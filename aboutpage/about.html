                    <p id="about">I've worked many years in construction, work ranging from framing for appartement
                        buildings, custom stucco siding,<br>
                        and road paving. I know what it means to grind and get the job done, whatever the conditions.
                       Also, I've learned to cooperate with my coworkers
                        through challenging situations. </p>

                    <p id="about">In the majority of my work, I've dealt with customers and prioritized customer service
                        in every situation. <br>
                        After working at Mcdonald's as a team lead, Residential duct cleaning, custom stucco siding, and
                        government operations, <br>
                        I've learned that customer satisfaction is paramount to any business operation. I find that it's
                        key to any negative situation with a customer, 
                        to attempt a resolution that benefits the company and assures customer retention.</p>

                    <p id="about">I've graduated from Police Foudations and am currently Pursuing a diploma in Computer
                        Programming. I've always <br>
                        loved learning new things and am excited about getting into the tech industry as it is
                        ever-evolving and contains problem solving. <br>
                        During my first semester, I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS, Arduino programming, and an
                        intro to Csharp. I have enjoyed spending countless hours
                        applying myself on projects and coming to solutions.

                    <p id="about">During my free time, I like to play video games with my friends and go out and about
                        with my partner. <br>
                        I value time with my family and friends as well as my cat, Moo. I love being outdoors as well,
                        especially camping and doing roadtrips <br>
                        to the city (Toronto, Ottawa, etc.). I have a big heart for animals and always try to help the
                        less fortunate if I can. <br> I can spend hours if I could, hanging out with cows and animals at the santuary. 
                       Lastly, I always try to put my best foot forward in any situation I am in.</p>
